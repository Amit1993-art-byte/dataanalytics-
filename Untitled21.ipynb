Explain the concept of skewness and its types. How does skewness affect the interpretation of data?\n","\n","# ANS: Skewness is a statistical measure that describes the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable\n","#      about its mean.

Data Visualization: Skewness can be easily observed in data visualizations like histograms or box plots. The shape of the\n","#         distribution reveals the presence of skewness, helping to understand the data's overall pattern and identify potential outliers.\n","\n","#      3. Statistical Analysis: Skewness can affect the outcomes of statistical analyses. Some statistical tests and models assume that the\n","#         data is normally distributed.

Recognizing the presence of skewness can help identify and appropriately handle\n","#         outliers in the data.\n","\n","#      5. Business Decisions: Understanding skewness is important in making informed business decisions. For example, in sales analysis,\n","#         if the revenue distribution is positively skewed, it might indicate a few large transactions that are driving the overall sales\n","#         figures. This can inform strategies for customer retention or targeting.\n","\n","#      In conclusion, skewness provides valuable information about the shape and distribution of data.
